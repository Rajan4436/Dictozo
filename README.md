Ever got frustrated while searching meaning of difficult English words online while reading your favorite article? Non-english people will better understand this issue. Yeah its bit infuriating when you came across same word whose meaning you've searched last week but now, it doesn't in your mind. U have to search same word again and cycle goes on.

Why not store that words somewhere, so that you have a list of most re-occurring/frequent used words and you can easily recall or memorize them all, once in a week.

Yeah now you can, word-o-save lets you store all those words with their meaning in your browser whose meaning you search most often online. In this way you have to memorize only those words which are frequently using now days. It saves your time that you devote looking for same word again and again, thereby enhances your reading skills. It is must for English learners and those who want to enhance their vocabulary.
